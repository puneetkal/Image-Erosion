### Theoretical Background

In image processing, <b>erosion</b> is a morphological operation used to remove small-scale noise and separate objects in an image. This technique works by <b>shrinking the boundaries</b> of the foreground object (typically white pixels) within a binary or grayscale image. The operation uses a <b>structuring element</b>, or <b>kernel</b>, which defines the shape and size of the area considered around each pixel. When applied, the kernel slides over the image, and if the kernel fits entirely within the foreground pixels, the center pixel is retained; otherwise, it is set to the background. Erosion is often used as a <b>preprocessing step</b> before further operations like segmentation or object detection.

### Code Explanation

Image Reading: The code begins by loading an image from a file named 'paritcles.jpg'. It uses OpenCVâ€™s imread function, which reads the image in color format (BGR).

Kernel Creation: A structuring element, or kernel, is defined. This kernel is a 3x5 matrix filled with ones. It serves as the basis for the erosion operation, determining how the image will be processed.

Iteration Count: The number of iterations for the erosion operation is set to 2. This means the erosion will be applied twice to the image.

Color Conversion: The original BGR image is converted to RGB format. This step is important for proper color representation when displaying the image later using visualization libraries.

Erosion Application: The erosion operation is performed on the original image using the defined kernel. This operation reduces the size of the foreground objects in the image, effectively removing small-scale noise and separating objects.

Figure Setup: A figure is created for plotting the images. The size of the figure is set to be wide to accommodate multiple images side by side.

Image Display: Three subplots are created within the figure:

The first subplot displays the original BGR image.
The second subplot shows the converted RGB image.
The third subplot presents the eroded image, highlighting the effect of the erosion operation, along with the number of iterations used.
Final Display: The eroded image is displayed again. This step may not be necessary if the previous subplot already shows it, but it reinforces the visualization of the result.
